Welcome to Age Of Heroes

This is an interactive application that allows to the user to tap into the heroic side of themselves.  This was created with the latest version of React.

It consists of four main sections.  The user can navigate through these four sectios using the navigation bar.  The navigation bar is color coded so that the tab is red when the respective section is in use and blue when it is not in use.

The first section is the Home Page.  It is somewhat philosophical because it introduces the user to the Hero's Journey.  It also orients the user to this application.

The second section Our Heroes is a Codex that is a repository of information on our heroes who are active in the Age of Heroes.  There are cards with the code name and alter ego of each superhero as well as a dynamic picture of them.  When the user clicks on a card it expands and displays the remainder of the information on that hero.  This includes their weapons, powers, team affiliations, and a famous saying of theirs.  Furthermore, the user can search for a hero by name or by team affiliation.

The third section is Become a Hero.  This consists of a registration form where the user can become a hero by entering the required information.  They will enter a code name, image URL, powers, weapons, desired team, and a memorable quote.  The user will then submit the information by clicking the Register Now button.  Upon submission the user will be added to the Superhero Codex.  The user can confirm this by navigating to the section Our Heroes and looking for their profile card in the Codex.

The fourth section is Heroes in Action.  This is a dynamic slide show which shows our heroes in some of their finest and most memorable moments.  It ranges from displays of flight, super speed, combat prowess, and more.
